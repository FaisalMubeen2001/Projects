The following project helps in predicting the rating of a Football Player during a match based on his statistics. 
Attributes such as Goals, Assists, Passes, Key Passes, Big chances Created, Shots taken, Shots on Target, Yellow cards, Red cards determine the overall rating of the player. 
In this, we have used Multiple Linear Regression to determine the match rating of the player. 
The metric 'R-Squared' was used to evaluate the model's performance.
The dataset was collected by myself and has more than 1200+ instances. Any other changes or recommendations to this project will be highly appreciated.
